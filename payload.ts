        "itinerary": "**Day 1: Arrive Perth**\n\nWelcome to sunny Perth, where your journey begins. You will be met at the airport (PER) and transferred by private vehicle to your accommodation – one of Perth's premier hotels, the elegant COMO The Treasury.\n\nEnjoy some time to settle in and unpack, before meeting your guide and fellow travellers for an evening tour through vibrant Perth. Weave your way through the streets to visit three unique bars and restaurants, with two drinks and nibbles included, taking in the thriving street art, laneways, intriguing spaces and rich history as you go.\n\n**Accommodation:** COMO The Treasury (Heritage Room)\n\n**Day 2: Perth – Rottnest Island – Perth**\n\nAfter breakfast, experience the exceptional beauty of Rottnest Island on a full-day tour. Enjoy a 30-minute ferry crossing to Thomson Bay, where you can collect your e-bike. Depart on a morning ride around half of the island, including the stunning West End, while keeping your eye out for the famous quokkas, before riding to the highest point of the island, Wadjemup.\n\nAfter working up an appetite, a long lunch of fresh gourmet dishes and drinks awaits in a stunning location with views over the turquoise waters. After lunch, head to a secluded beach, where you can choose to snorkel the most southerly coral reefs in the world, wade in the shallows or simply relax and read a book.\n\nDepart the island and return to Perth, where a three-course dinner and glass of wine at a local restaurant await.\n\n**Accommodation:** COMO The Treasury (Heritage Room)\n\n**Meals:** Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner with Wine\n\n**Day 3: Perth – Margaret River – Cape to Cape Track (Smiths Beach to Indjiup Beach)**\n\nPut your best foot forward and hit the trails for your first leg of the Cape to Cape Track, one of the Great Walks of Australia. Over the next four days, you will walk the best sections of the Cape to Cape, staying in luxury accommodation and enjoying exclusive Margaret River food and wine experiences along the way.\n\nAfter breakfast, leave Perth behind and set your sights on Margaret River. Hit the Cape to Cape Track for the first section – from Smiths Beach to Injidup Beach – with lunch and a swim in a secluded bay en route. Find your feet as you walk past rugged terrain and across beaches, watching out for dolphins off the coast.\n\nOn arrival at Injidup Spa Retreat, enjoy a welcome drink on the clifftop (weather permitting) before settling in to enjoy some wine and cheese and your first sunset by your villa plunge pool.
